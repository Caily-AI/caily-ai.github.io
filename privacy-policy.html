        <p><strong>Nondiscrimination</strong></p>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you for exercising your privacy rights.</p>
        <p>If you reside in California, Colorado, or Connecticut, you can designate an authorized agent to submit a privacy rights request on your behalf.

Unless requested by us, please do not provide any sensitive personal information in connection with the request, such as a driver’s license or other government issued ID. In some cases, we may be required to contact the individual who is the subject of the request to verify his or her own identity or confirm the authorized agent has permission to submit this request.
